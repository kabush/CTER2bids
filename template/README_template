The dataset represents the raw data supporting the Brain and
Behavioral Research Foundation NARSAD Young Investigator Award
(#26079), titled "A Causal Test of Emotion Regulation in the Affective
Perception of Visual Stimuli

# BOLD SIGNAL
#
# The bold signal was acquired using the Philips Achieva seq+z slice timing
# with 37 slices. Based on TR=2.0 s, this sequence creates an inter-slice
# interval of 0.0541 s.  The following array has been copied into the SliceTime 
# arrays of the template json files.

# EVENTS
#
# Modulate events special cases ***NOT*** handled by mapping code.  These
#      events should be removed (via hand editting if necessary) as the
#      true onset of the stimulus cannot be determined post-hoc.
